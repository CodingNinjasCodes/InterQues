                <p>
                    Tweening is the process in which we create intermediate frames between two images to get the appearance of the first image which develops into the second image.
                       <br>
                    It is mainly used for creating animation. 
                    There are two types of tween's:
                    <ol>
                        <li> Motion Tween </li>
                        <li> Shape Tween</li>
                    </ol>
                    A Motion tween animates symbols moving in space, through which you can move the Symbol in any keyframe, <br>
                    whereas Shape tween performs distortions on non symbol graphics. <br>
                        

<ul>
<li>Tweening is not a term that's used too often in CSS. </li> 
<li> It has its roots in computer animation. </li> 
 <li> Rather than telling the program exactly how to render each frame, <br>
 the animator would tell the program what position the objects are in at two "keyframes"  <br>
 and the program would figure out how to transition the objects between those two points. </li> 

 <li> In CSS we usually use the term "animate", but the concepts are the same. </li>  
 <br>
This simple example demonstrates how to make a paragraph element slide in from off the right edge of the browser window:
<br>
<br>

    <code>
p {
  animation-duration: 3s; <br>
  animation-name: slidein; <br>
}  <br>

@keyframes slidein { <br>
  from {        <br>
    margin-left: 100%; <br>
    width: 300%;      <br>
  }                 <br>

  to {             <br>
    margin-left: 0%;    <br>
    width: 100%;       <br>
  }             <br>
}       <br>
</code>
