               <p>
                <strong>Functions</strong> In JavaScript are <strong>First-class Objects</strong> because they are treated as any other value in the language.
                They can be assigned to <strong>variables</strong>, they can be <strong>properties of an object</strong> which are called <strong>methods</strong>,
                they can be an item in array, they can be passed as arguments to a function, and they can be returned
                as values of a function. The only difference between a function and any other value in JavaScript is
                that functions can be invoked or called.
