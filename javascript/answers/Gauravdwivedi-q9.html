<h4>What is NaN? What is its type? How can you reliably test if a value is equal to NaN?</h4><br>
<p>The <code>NaN</code> property represents a value that is “not a number”. This special value results from an operation that could not be performed either because one of the operands was non-numeric (e.g., "abc" / 4), or because the result of the operation is non-numeric.</p>
<p>
While this seems straightforward enough, there are a couple of somewhat surprising characteristics of NaN that can result in hair-pulling bugs if one is not aware of them.</p>

For one thing, although NaN means “not a number”, its type is, believe it or not, Number:
<p><code>
console.log(typeof NaN === "number");  // logs "true"</code>
Additionally, NaN compared to anything – even itself! – is false:</p>
<p>
console.log(NaN === NaN);  // logs "false"
A semi-reliable way to test whether a number is equal to NaN is with the built-in function isNaN(), but even using isNaN() is an imperfect solution.</p>
<p>
A better solution would either be to use value !== value, which would only produce true if the value is equal to NaN. Also, ES6 offers a new Number.isNaN() function, which is a different and more reliable than the old global isNaN() function.
