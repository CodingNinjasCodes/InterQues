                <strong>Answer:</strong>
                <p> There are two ways for accomplishing event propagation and the order in which an event is received in the HTML DOM API</p>
                <p>These are Event Bubbling and Event Capturing. In the former, the event is directed towards its intended target, whereas the event goes down to the element in the latter.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Event Capturing </b> - Also known as trickling, Event Capturing is rarely used. The process starts with the outermost element capturing the event and then propagating the same to the innermost element.</li>
                <li><b>Event Bubbling </b> - In this process, the event gets handled by the innermost element first and then propagated to the outermost element.</li>
            </ul>
