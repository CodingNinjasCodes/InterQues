            <strong>Answer:</strong>
            <p>The defer attribute is a boolean attribute.
                When present, it specifies that the script is executed when the page has finished parsing.</p>

            <p>As the document parser goes through the page, this is what occurs -</p>
            <img src="../../assets/images/keshav37a/Normal-Execution.png">

            <p>The defer attribute tells the browser to only execute the script file once the HTML document has been
                fully parsed.</p>

            <img src="../../assets/images/keshav37a/Defer-Execution.png">

            <p>The file can be downloaded while the HTML document is still parsing. However, even if the file is fully
                downloaded long before the document is finished parsing, the script is not executed until the parsing is
                complete.</p>

            <p>By default, the parsing of the HTML code, during page loading, is paused until the script has not stopped
                executing. It means, if the server is slow or the script is particularly heavy, then the webpage is
                displayed with a delay. While using Deferred, scripts delays execution of the script till the time HTML
                parser is running. This reduces the loading time of web pages and they get displayed faster.</p>

            <p>Syntax:<br>
                &ltscript defer>&lt/script></p>

            <p>Example:<br>

                &ltp>&ltscript> <br>
                //do stuff (runs first) <br>
                &lt/script> <br><br>
                &ltscript defer> <br>
                //do stuff, but defer it (runs last) <br>
                &lt/script> <br><br>
                &ltscript> <br>
                //do more stuff (runs second) <br>
                &lt/script>&lt/p> <br>
            </p>
