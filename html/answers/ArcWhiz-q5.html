                <p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Inline</h6>
                            <p>These elements do not break the flow of the document. That means that they don't begin on a new line and they only take as much space as the elements inside them take. They don't have height and width properties.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Block</h6>
                            <p>These elements do not sit inline but break past them (i.e. start on a new line). By default (without setting a width) they take up as much horizontal space as they can.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <h6>Inline-Block</h6>
                            <p>These elements are very similar to inline elements in that it will set inline with the natural flow of text (on the "baseline"). The difference is that you are able to set a width and height which will be respected.</p>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
