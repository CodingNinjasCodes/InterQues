# InterQues (https://codingninjascodes.github.io/InterQues)
This is a collaborative repository aimed at getting tech interview questions and obviously their solutions. This will be written in plain HTML (we might later introduce CSS), although the interview questions could be from any domain.

### What's amazing?
It's going to be completely compiled by our students

## How it works?
This is started as a learning project for students who are looking for a complete list of interview questions.
**One question can have only one correct answer**
You can add a question (with an answer), suggest changes.



## Contribution guidelines / Steps

- fork this repository into your github account (create one if you don't have it yet)
- clone it to your system (git clone <link>)
- in the terminal run `git remote add upstream https://github.com/CodingNinjasCodes/InterQues.git` (this is for taking a fresh update of the code anytime in the future)
- create a new branch from the [Branch Types](#branch-types) below
- make the changes, commit and push them to your forked repository
- create a pull request (mark an issue if it resolves one)
- getting updated code, just run git pull upstream master


##### Branch Types
- doc-*branch name* (Changes to documentation)
- newq-*branch name* (For adding a new question)
- correction-*branch name* (Making a correction to an answer/question)
